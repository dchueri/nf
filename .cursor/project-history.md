# Central de Notas PJ - Project History

## Background and Motivation

**Business Concept:** Central de Notas PJ is a Micro-SaaS designed to solve the recurring pain point of managing invoices from PJ (Pessoa Jurídica) collaborators. The target market is small to medium businesses in Florianópolis that regularly contract PJ collaborators and struggle with invoice collection, organization, and payment processing.

**Core Problem:** Monthly manual invoice collection from PJ collaborators creates administrative overhead, payment delays, and fiscal compliance risks. Current solutions (ERPs, manual processes) are either too complex/expensive or too basic.

**Market Opportunity:** Direct approach to local startups, marketing agencies, and tech consultancies in Florianópolis with a simple, focused solution.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Centralized invoice management and storage
- Automated approval workflows
- Real-time financial tracking and reporting
- Compliance with Brazilian tax regulations
- Team collaboration and role-based access control

**Target Market:** Small to medium Brazilian companies (10-500 employees) struggling with invoice management efficiency.
